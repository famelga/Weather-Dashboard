## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://famelga.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/)

I have used a third-party API to retrieve data from openweathermap.org to create a weather dashboard.

Before using the API, I needed to set up my html framework. I created a header and search tools on the body. I included the search text box and button, along with their subheading in a div tag. This div tag allowed for all of the children to be formatted together at the upper-left hand corner for the main body. These were styled directly in the html using Bootstrap, rather than in the style.css document. I also included div tags as placeholders for where the returned responses from the API would be displayed on the html.

In JavaScript, I created an eventlistener for the search button. This eventlistener triggers a series of functions that work to retrieve the necessary data from the API. I console.logged the returned data, then traversed the console to call on the data that was retrieved from the API. I attempted to include this data on by html by using textContent and appendChild. While some of the data displayed onto the website, I received an error message stating that the data was not recognized.

## Portfolio Example

Here is an example of the code I used to extract the data in the console that was received from the API.

```
    var todayEl = document.getElementById("today");
    var nameEl = document.createElement("h2");
    nameEl.textContent = data.name;
    todayEl.appendChild(nameEl);
```
This is where I wanted to place the data on the html.
```
<div id="today" class="current-date"></div>
```

## Learning Points 


While I struggled with displaying the response from the API, I learned the proper format to fetch an APi and its promise. I was also able to successfully use bootstrap to style my html without css.
